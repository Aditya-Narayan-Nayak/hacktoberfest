# hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest 2020 is a month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!
What is HacktoberFest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long community event in October where people from all sorts of professions come to help each other to learn & share new skills through contributing to open-source projects and to support the open-source community. Participants also win awesome swag like the T-Shirt we just mentioned.

The main aim of Hacktoberfest is to encourage people to contribute more to open source projects.

If you don't know what are open source projects, open-source projects are the projects where anyone can make their own contributions through various means regardless of their relation to the project or to the project owners.

Anyone can participate in Hacktoberfest & it is not at all mandatory to have any experience or knowledge in coding.

Are there any Prerequisites?
The contributions for Hacktoberfest takes place through Git & GitHub, so you need to have some basic knowledge of Git & Github. You don't really have to learn everything about them. Well, if you know how to make a pull request, then you already have sufficient knowledge required for Hacktoberfest.

But if you don't, below are some useful resources for you to learn and master Git & GitHub in no time:

Git & Github Crash Course by freecodecamp
Git Tutorial for Beginners
GitHub Guide
Apart from the basic knowledge of Git & GitHub, you don't really need to have any other skill to get started.

You can contribute with whatever skills you currently have. No need to learn something new (although it's always good to learn new stuff)...
